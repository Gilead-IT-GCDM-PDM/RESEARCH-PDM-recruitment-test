# RESEARCH-PDM-recruitment-test

This is a public project which is designed to test candidate python and sql ability. 

There are 2 parts which need to be created 

1. Do the ETL and update the database with the 3 files 
    * deathstar_roster_2022_05_04.csv
    * shuttle_2022_06_01.csv
    * shuttle_2022_06_08.csv
2. Create the pie graph on the main page
    * Hook up the filters with the callback

# HINTS
- We do not use deathstar_roster_2022_05_04.csv.
- You must use shuttle_2022_06_01.csv
- Bonus points for shuttle_2022_06_08.csv , this case is much harder. 
- There are multiple ways of doing the ETL, some are python, some are tools + sql, all are acceptable if you demonstrate mastery
- UI fixes should be relatively minor, I do suggest looking at plotly express for the pie graph
